# Toxicity-Analysis-BERT-LSTM-LR
Benchmarking Logistic Regression, LSTM, BERT, and RoBERTa for toxicity classification using the Civil Comments dataset. This project compares traditional and neural models on multi-label tasks (e.g., toxic, obscene) with metrics like AUC-ROC and F1-score, featuring model implementation, fine-tuning, and result visualization.
