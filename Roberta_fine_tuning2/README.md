# RoBERTa Fine Tuning

This project provides a structured pipeline for preparing a dataset, training a machine learning model, and testing its performance.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

### Steps to Run the Project

1. **Clone the Repository**

   Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**

   Create and activate a virtual environment to isolate dependencies:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   # Activate the environment:
   # On Windows
   venv\Scripts\activate
   # On macOS/Linux
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**

   Install the required packages using `requirements.txt`:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Prepare the Dataset**

   Run the dataset preparation script:
   ```bash
   python prepare_dataset.py
   ```

5. **Train the Model**

   Train the model using the provided training script:
   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```

6. **Test the Model**

   Test the trained model to evaluate its performance:
   ```bash
   python test.py
   ```

### Notes

- Ensure all scripts (e.g., `prepare_dataset.py`, `train.py`, `test.py`) are present in the repository directory.
- Check the output logs for any errors and address them as needed.
